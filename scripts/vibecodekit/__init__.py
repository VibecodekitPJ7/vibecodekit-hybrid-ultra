"""VibecodeKit Hybrid Ultra — Full Agentic OS Runtime + Methodology Overlay.

Runtime layer: 30 probes corresponding 1:1 to the architectural patterns from
"Giải phẫu một Agentic Operating System" (Lâm Nguyễn, 2026) —
async generator loop, five-layer context defence, 7 task kinds,
4-phase DreamTask, MCP stdio, 33 hook events, cost ledger,
cross-platform (fcntl/msvcrt) locked denial store, 3-tier memory
hierarchy with pluggable embedding, approval/elicitation JSON contract,
follow-up re-execute loop, conditional skill activation.

Methodology layer: 9 extra probes exercising RRI (Reverse Requirements
Interview), RRI-T (7-dim testing × 8-stress-axis), RRI-UX (Flow Physics),
RRI-UI (4-phase pipeline), VIBECODE-MASTER workflow, Vietnamese
12-item checklist, and the 6 methodology slash-commands.

Public API is exposed via the ``cli`` module (``python -m vibecodekit.cli``)
and via the command-line scripts installed under ``ai-rules/vibecodekit/bin``.

Version resolution:

``__version__`` is single-sourced from the bundle's ``VERSION`` file
(same directory as ``SKILL.md``).  When ``VERSION`` cannot be found
(e.g. a partial copy without the bundle root), falls back to
``importlib.metadata`` (works when installed via ``pip install``).
If neither source is available the module raises ``RuntimeError``
so stale hard-coded fallbacks never ship silently.

Use ``vibecodekit.VERSION`` or ``vibecodekit.__version__`` for the
resolved value.
