"""Runtime doctor — validates a vibecode project layout.

Graceful: when asked to run against a *skill bundle* (no ``.claw.json``, no
``CLAUDE.md``, no ``ai-rules``) it reports which optional files are missing
without failing the whole check.  This fixes the v0.6 regression where
``runtime_doctor_v06`` mis-classified skill bundles as broken projects.
