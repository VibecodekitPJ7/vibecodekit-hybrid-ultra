# Benchmarks & Methodology

> **TL;DR:** The "87/87 @ 100 %" number in our docs is a
> **self-conformance regression test**, not an external quality benchmark.
> It proves the runtime has not regressed since the last release — it
> does **not** measure code-generation quality, bug-fix rate, or
> reasoning depth.

## 1. What `conformance_audit` actually measures

`conformance_audit` (invoked via `/vibe-audit` or the CLI) runs 87
internal probes (at v0.16.2; count grows with each release) that check
**architectural invariants**:

| Category | Example probes | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Module wiring | "Does `intent_router` map all 42 slash commands?" | No dead-code or orphan modules |
| Hook coverage | "Are all 33 lifecycle events in `SUPPORTED_EVENTS`?" | Hook system is complete |
| ACL profiles | "Does `qa` role have `can_mutate=False`?" | Permission model intact |
| Frontmatter integrity | "Does every `/vck-*` command have `inspired-by:`?" | Attribution metadata present |
| Methodology gates | "Does RRI question bank cover 5 personas x 3 modes?" | Methodology coverage |
| Security hardening | "Is Unicode Cf-class normalisation applied?" | Permission bypass classes closed |

Passing 87/87 means: **"the runtime has not regressed against its own
specification."**

## 2. What it does NOT measure

| Dimension | Measured by | Status in VCK-HU |
|---|---|---|
| Code generation quality | HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench | Not yet benchmarked |
| Real-world bug-fix rate | SWE-bench Lite, SWE-bench Verified | Not yet benchmarked |
| Reasoning depth | ARC, GPQA, MATH | Not yet benchmarked |
| Agent autonomy | METR HCAST, AgentBench, WebArena | Not yet benchmarked |
| End-user satisfaction | A/B test, NPS, task-completion rate | Not yet benchmarked |

**Important:** "100 % parity" in our docs refers to parity with the
project's own internal specification ("Giai phau mot Agentic Operating
System"), **not** parity with any external model or tool.

## 3. How to read our quality claims

| Claim in docs | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| "87/87 probes pass" | All internal regression invariants hold |
| "100 % parity" | Runtime matches its own architectural spec |
| "passes conformance audit" | Self-test gate; not an external benchmark |
| "588 pytest cases pass" | Unit + integration tests pass (code correctness) |
| "release-matrix L1+L2+L3 PASS" | Layout validation across 3 deployment modes |

## 4. Roadmap for external benchmarks (Phase 2)

We plan to add external benchmark runs to provide ground-truth quality
numbers.  Candidates (in order of implementation priority):

1. **HumanEval** (164 tasks) — classic function-completion benchmark.
   Low cost (~$5/run), fast (~10 min), well-understood baseline.
2. **MBPP** (974 tasks) — broader function-level benchmark.
3. **SWE-bench Lite** (300 tasks) — real-world bug fixes on real repos.
   Industry-standard for agent evaluation.
4. **BigCodeBench** (1140 tasks) — harder function-level tasks.

Results will be tracked in `benchmarks/` with timestamp + git SHA,
run nightly on `main`, and referenced from this document.

## 5. Contributing benchmark results

If you run VCK-HU against any external benchmark, we welcome PRs adding
results to `benchmarks/<benchmark-name>/results.json`.  Include:

- Git SHA of the VCK-HU version tested
- Benchmark version / split used
- Raw pass rate and any relevant metrics
- Hardware / model backend used
- Cost per run

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for general PR guidelines.
