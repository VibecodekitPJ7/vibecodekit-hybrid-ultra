# Deep audit cycle — VibecodeKit Hybrid Ultra v0.14.0

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Branch under audit:** `main` @ `140739b` (merged PR #2)
**Methodology:** VIBECODE-MASTER-v5 + RRI-T (Reverse Requirements Interview — Testing)
**Auditor:** automated cycle (5 personas × 7 dimensions × 8 stress axes)
**Outcome:** 1 P0 + 4 P1 defects found and fixed in this PR.
            All P2 are accepted/documented limitations.

> **Follow-up — v0.14.1 + v0.15.0 deep-dive (2026-04-29).**  A second
> audit pass surfaced four *dormant-code* findings (D1–D4) that this
> v0.14.0 cycle did not catch: `team_mode`, `eval_select`, `learnings`,
> and `security_classifier` were all shipping but not wired to a
> production call site (only via tests + docs).  All four were closed
> in the v0.15.0 "One Pipeline, Zero Dead-Code" rollout — see
> [`docs/INTEGRATION-PLAN-v0.15.md`](INTEGRATION-PLAN-v0.15.md) for the
> integration plan and the
> [v0.15.0 CHANGELOG entries](../CHANGELOG.md#0150--one-pipeline-zero-dead-code)
> for the four PRs that landed the wiring.  The new audit probes
> #78–#85 (T7 + T9) act as the invariant guard so this class of
> dormant-code regression cannot be reintroduced silently.

## 1. Scope

The audit targets every artefact added or changed by v0.14.0 (Phase 3 + 4):

| Artefact | LOC | Surface under test |
|---|---:|---|
| `scripts/vibecodekit/security_classifier.py` | 506 | regex bank, ONNX layer, Haiku layer, ensemble vote, hook integration |
| `scripts/vibecodekit/eval_select.py`         | 234 | touchfile map, glob/prefix matching, fallback, CLI |
| `scripts/vibecodekit/learnings.py`           | 233 | JSONL store, 3-tier scope, fcntl lock, atomic append |
| `scripts/vibecodekit/team_mode.py`           | 176 | team.json read/write, gate enforcement |
| `update-package/.claw/hooks/pre_tool_use.py` | +22 | optional classifier wiring |
| 8 slash-command skill files                  | ~600 | manifest + intent_router + subagent_runtime wiring |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml`                   | 59  | pytest + audit + release-matrix |
| Probes #68–#77 (10 new conformance probes)   | +199 | behaviour-based gating |

Out of scope (audited in earlier cycles): the v0.12.0 browser daemon, the
6-layer permission engine, and the 67 pre-existing conformance probes.

## 2. Methodology mapping

### 2.1 Five testing personas

The audit walked through each module from each persona's mental model.

| Persona | Findings |
|---|---|
| End User | None (CLI surfaces clean, JSON output deterministic). |
| Business Analyst | F4 — `TeamConfig.from_dict` silent type coercion contradicts the documented contract. |
| QA Destroyer | F2 — newline-split bypasses `pi-ignore-prior`. F5 — empty patterns in `eval_select` violate the docstring's "always run" guarantee. |
| DevOps Tester | F1 — concurrent writers race on `team.json.tmp`. |
| Security Auditor | F2 + F3 — newline + LOCALE bypasses are real attack vectors. |

### 2.2 Seven testing dimensions

Only the dimensions that apply to a backend/CLI module are reported.

| Dimension | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| D1 UI/UX | n/a | No UI surface in scope (CLI + markdown only). |
| D2 API | **PASS after fix** | F4 fixed the silent string-iteration footgun. |
| D3 Performance | PASS | Regex bank evaluates a 1 MB benign input in <50 ms; ONNX/Haiku layers self-disable when deps absent. |
| D4 Security | **PASS after fix** | F2 + F3 fixed (newline split + VN injections). |
| D5 Data Integrity | **PASS after fix** | F1 fixed (concurrent write race). Concurrent learnings appends already correct (5×40 = 200 unique). |
| D6 Infrastructure | PASS | CI matrix (3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12) green; release-matrix L1+L2+L3 PASS. |
| D7 Edge cases | **PASS after fix** | F5 fixed (empty patterns). Bytes input, `None` input, huge input all behave acceptably (raise-or-truncate, never silent corruption). |

### 2.3 Eight stress axes

| Axis | Probe | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 TIME | Bulk classify of 1 000 prompts under 1 s | PASS |
| 2 DATA | 1 MB benign input + 1 MB injection | PASS |
| 3 ERROR | Corrupt JSONL, malformed team.json, missing model file | PASS (after F4 fix) |
| 4 COLLAB | 5 threads × 40 learnings appends; 8 threads × 1 team-init write | **F1 found and fixed** |
| 5 EMERGENCY | Hook crashes must never deny the permission path | PASS — both `try/except` envelopes are tight |
| 6 SECURITY | Regex evasion (newline, ZWSP, homoglyph, spaced) | **F2 found + fixed**; ZWSP / homoglyph documented as known regex limits — relies on optional ML layers |
| 7 INFRA | CI on 3 Python versions | PASS |
| 8 LOCALE | Vietnamese-language injection | **F3 found and fixed** |

## 3. Findings

### F1 — `team_mode.write_team_config` race (P0, COLLAB axis, D5)

**Reproduce:**
```python
threads = [Thread(target=lambda i=i: write_team_config(
    TeamConfig(team_id=f't{i}', required=(f'/{i}',)),
    root=tmp_path)) for i in range(8)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
```

Pre-fix output:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] '/tmp/.../.vibecode/team.json.tmp' -> '...team.json'
```

**Root cause:** all writers rendered to a single shared `.tmp` path
(`team.json.tmp`); whichever thread `os.replace`-ed first vapourised the
file underneath the others.

**Fix:** use `tempfile.mkstemp(prefix=p.name+'.', suffix='.tmp', dir=p.parent)`
for a per-writer unique tmp path; `os.replace` remains atomic; cleanup on
failure is best-effort.  Regression test: `test_team_mode_concurrent_writers_no_race`.

### F2 — `security_classifier` newline-split bypass (P1, D4 + D7)

**Reproduce:**
```python
sc.RegexLayer().vote('Ignore\nall\nprevious\ninstructions').vote
# Pre-fix → 'allow' (silent bypass)
```

**Root cause:** five injection rules used `[^.\n]{0,60}` to bound the
span between trigger words; the explicit `\n` exclusion meant attackers
who newline-split their prose escaped detection.

**Fix:** drop the `\n` exclusion (`[^.]{0,80}`).  Period is still the
sentence terminator, so the regex still won't run across distinct
sentences.  Span limits bumped 60 → 80 / 40 → 60 to recover precision
on the larger character class.  Regression tests:
`test_regex_blocks_newline_split_injection` (3 cases).

### F3 — Vietnamese-language injection coverage (P1, LOCALE axis)

**Reproduce:**
```python
sc.RegexLayer().vote('Bỏ qua tất cả các hướng dẫn trước đó').vote
# Pre-fix → 'allow'
```

**Root cause:** rule bank shipped English-only; project is VN-first.
RRI-T methodology axis 8 (LOCALE) explicitly requires Vietnamese
coverage for VN-targeted SaaS.

**Fix:** added 4 Vietnamese rules
(`pi-vn-ignore-prior`, `pi-vn-you-are-now`,
 `pi-vn-system-prompt-leak`, `pi-vn-roleplay-override`).  Rule count:
24 → 28.  Regression tests: 6 positive + 4 negative cases for benign
VN prose.

### F4 — `TeamConfig.from_dict` silent string-iteration (P1, D2 API)

**Reproduce:**
```python
TeamConfig.from_dict({'required': 'oops'})
# Pre-fix → required=('o','o','p','s')
```

**Root cause:** `tuple(value)` accepts any iterable and a `str` is
iterable.  A hand-edited team.json with a stringified field silently
corrupts into a per-character tuple — confusing diagnostics later when
gates "didn't run" because they don't match the corrupted required set.

**Fix:** validate type explicitly; raise `ValueError` on non-list/tuple.
`read_team_config` widens its except clause to
`(JSONDecodeError, ValueError, TypeError)` so the runtime degrades to
"no team mode" instead of crashing a hook.

### F5 — `eval_select` empty-patterns silently skipped (P1, D7)

**Reproduce:**
```python
eval_select.select_tests(['src/x.py'], {'tests/y.py': []}).selected
# Pre-fix → []  (despite docstring saying empty entries fall back to "always run")
```

**Root cause:** `_normalise_entry([])` returned `[]`, which produced
`real=[]` → no patterns → no matches → not selected, not always-run.
Direct contradiction of the module docstring's "conservative by design"
contract.

**Fix:** empty list / empty `files` (without explicit `always_run: false`)
now promotes to `__ALWAYS__`, matching the documented behaviour.
Regression tests: `test_eval_select_empty_patterns_are_always_run`,
`test_eval_select_empty_dict_files_are_always_run`,
`test_eval_select_explicit_pattern_still_targeted`.

### Accepted P2 (documented limitations)

| Issue | Decision |
|---|---|
| Homoglyph evasion (Cyrillic `І` → Latin `I`) | Out of scope for the regex layer — rely on optional ONNX layer.  Documented in module docstring. |
| Zero-width-space evasion | Same. |
| Spaced-out characters (`I g n o r e`) | Same. |
| `is_team_mode()` returns True on corrupt file | Acceptable — `read_team_config` returns `None`, downstream `assert_required_gates_run` no-ops. |
| Bytes input to classifier raises `TypeError` | Acceptable — caller's responsibility to decode. |

## 4. Verification

| Gate | Pre-fix | Post-fix |
|---|---|---|
| `pytest tests` | 517 / 15 | **536 / 0** (+19 regression cases; -15 dead skips from deleted `test_version_sync.py`) |
| `conformance_audit --threshold 1.0` | 77 / 77 | **77 / 77** |
| `validate_release_matrix.py` | PASS | **PASS** |
| GitHub Actions CI (3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12) | green | green (re-run on this PR) |

---

## 5. RRI 5-persona narrative review (architecture-level)

| Persona | Read of the architecture |
|---|---|
| **Cynic** | "ML layers self-disable cleanly — regex is the load-bearing layer.  Acceptable: attribution clear, weights not shipped, 2-of-3 conservative." |
| **Skeptic** | "Two-of-three vote with optional layers means a hostile environment with `[ml]` extras installed but no model file still defaults to `allow`.  Documented; explicit env var contract." |
| **Trickster** | "Newline-split + VN injection = real bypass.  → F2 + F3." |
| **Auditor** | "team.json races under concurrency.  → F1.  Doc/behavior drift in eval_select.  → F5." |
| **Lead** | "Public surface is documented, regression tests pin every fix, conformance audit & release matrix gate the change.  Ship it." |
